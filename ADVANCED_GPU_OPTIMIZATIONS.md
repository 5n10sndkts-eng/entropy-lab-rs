4. **Async Transfers**: Overlap compute and memory (15-30% gain)
5. **End-to-End GPU**: Minimize CPU-GPU round trips (major gain)

## Advanced Optimization Opportunities

### Phase 1: Local Memory for Hash Operations (Priority: HIGH)

**Target Files**: `cl/sha2.cl`, `cl/sha512.cl`, `cl/batch_address.cl`

**Optimization**: Store SHA-256/SHA-512 working blocks in local memory shared across workgroup.

**Implementation**:
```c
__kernel void batch_address_with_local(
    __global const ulong * restrict entropies_hi,
    __global const ulong * restrict entropies_lo,
    __global uchar * restrict output_addresses,
    uint purpose,
    __local uint * restrict local_workspace  // NEW: shared workspace
) {
    const uint local_id = get_local_id(0);
    const uint group_id = get_group_id(0);
    const uint group_size = get_local_size(0);
    
    // Allocate per-thread space in local memory
    __local uint *my_workspace = &local_workspace[local_id * 64]; // 64 uints = 256 bytes
    
    // Use local workspace for SHA-256/SHA-512 operations
    // ... rest of kernel
}
```

**Expected Gain**: 20-40% (based on BTCRecover published results and OpenCL best practices)

**Note**: These performance estimates are based on:
- BTCRecover's documented GPU acceleration guide showing 14-100x gains with similar techniques
- OpenCL optimization literature indicating 20-40% gains from local memory for hash operations
- Actual gains will vary by GPU vendor, driver version, and workload characteristics
- Validation on target hardware is required to confirm these projections

**Rationale**: 
- Local memory is 10-100x faster than global memory
- Hash operations perform many repeated reads/writes to working state
- Workgroup can share memory bandwidth efficiently

### Phase 2: Vector Type Operations (Priority: HIGH)

**Target Files**: `cl/sha2.cl`, `cl/secp256k1_field.cl`

**Optimization**: Use vector types (uint4, uint8) for SIMD operations in hash rounds.

**Implementation**:
```c
// Current: Scalar operations
unsigned int w0_t = W[0];
unsigned int w1_t = W[1];
unsigned int w2_t = W[2];
unsigned int w3_t = W[3];

// Optimized: Vector operations
uint4 w_vec0 = vload4(0, W);  // Load 4 words at once
uint4 w_vec1 = vload4(1, W);
// Process 4 rounds simultaneously
```

**Expected Gain**: 10-25% (vendor hardware dependent)

**Rationale**:
- Modern GPUs have SIMD execution units
- Vector operations reduce instruction count
- Better register utilization

### Phase 3: Kernel Fusion (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Target Files**: `src/scans/gpu_solver.rs`, new fused kernel in `cl/`

**Optimization**: Combine multiple kernel launches into single kernels.

**Current Flow** (multiple launches):
1. Generate mnemonic from entropy
2. PBKDF2 (2048 iterations)
3. Derive keys
4. Generate address

**Optimized Flow** (single launch):
- All operations in one kernel
- No intermediate GPU-CPU-GPU transfers
- Reduced kernel launch overhead

**Expected Gain**: 10-20%

**Rationale**:
- Each kernel launch has ~10-50μs overhead
- Intermediate results stay in registers/local memory
- Reduces global memory traffic

### Phase 4: Asynchronous Transfers with Dual Queues (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Target Files**: `src/scans/gpu_solver.rs`

**Optimization**: Overlap computation with data transfers using multiple command queues.

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct GpuSolver {
    pro_que: ProQue,
    compute_queue: Queue,  // NEW: dedicated compute queue
    transfer_queue: Queue, // NEW: dedicated transfer queue
    // ...
}

impl GpuSolver {
    pub fn compute_batch_async(&self, ...) -> ocl::Result<Vec<[u8; 25]>> {
        // Start transfer of next batch on transfer_queue
        // While compute_queue is processing current batch
        // Pipeline: Transfer(N+1) || Compute(N) || Transfer_back(N-1)
    }
}
```

**Expected Gain**: 15-30% for large batch workloads

**Rationale**:
- Hide memory transfer latency behind computation
- Proven technique in BitCrack and Vanitygen++
- Most effective for batch processing scenarios

### Phase 5: Workgroup Barrier Optimization (Priority: LOW)

**Target Files**: All kernel files using local memory

**Optimization**: Minimize barrier() calls and optimize synchronization patterns.

**Implementation**:
- Analyze data dependencies
- Use barrier() only when truly needed
- Group operations to reduce sync points

**Expected Gain**: 5-10%

**Rationale**:
- Barriers stall all threads in workgroup
- Unnecessary barriers waste cycles
- Careful analysis can eliminate redundant syncs

### Phase 6: Register Pressure Optimization (Priority: LOW)

**Target Files**: `cl/batch_address.cl`, complex kernels

**Optimization**: Reduce register usage per thread to increase occupancy.

**Techniques**:
- Reduce number of live variables
- Reuse variables when safe
- Use local memory for spills instead of registers

**Expected Gain**: 5-15% (architecture dependent)

**Rationale**:
- Limited registers per compute unit
- High register usage reduces active wavefronts
- More wavefronts = better latency hiding

## CUDA vs OpenCL Decision

### Analysis
Based on research and project requirements:

**OpenCL Advantages** (Current choice ✅):
- Cross-platform: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel GPUs
- Rust ecosystem: mature `ocl` crate
- Sufficient performance for use case
- Wider deployment compatibility

**CUDA Advantages**:
- 5-10% better performance on NVIDIA GPUs
- Better tooling (Nsight Compute, NSight Systems)
- More optimized libraries (cuBLAS, cuFFT)
- Tighter hardware integration

**Recommendation**: **Stick with OpenCL**

**Rationale**:
1. Project targets security researchers with diverse hardware
2. OpenCL achieves 90-95% of CUDA performance when optimized
3. Adding CUDA would require dual codebase (2x maintenance)
4. OpenCL optimizations apply to all vendors
5. No CUDA-specific features needed for these algorithms

**Optional**: Consider CUDA as future enhancement if NVIDIA-specific deployment is critical, but NOT for initial optimization work.
