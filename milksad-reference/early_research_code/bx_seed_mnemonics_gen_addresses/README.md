# Documentation

Experimental code to invoke `bx mnemonic-new` many times to generate weak mnemonics, and derive some addresses from them. Uses the PostgreSQL database for storing results.

Restarting the target binary over and over is slow, but it was the first strategy to try before we moved to more optimized, custom implementations and provided reference data for the original behavior.

## Usage
