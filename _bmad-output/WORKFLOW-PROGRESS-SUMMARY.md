- `_bmad-output/development-guide.md` - Developer guide
- `_bmad-output/BMAD-COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md` - Compliance report

### ✅ Phase 0.5: Implementation Readiness (Winston - Architect)
**Completed:** 2025-12-17 (earlier today)
- Implementation readiness assessment executed
- Validated existing architecture (95/100)
- Identified critical gaps for new features

**Artifacts Generated:**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-readiness-report-2025-12-17.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Existing features: PRODUCTION READY (95/100)
- New features (Randstorm): BLOCKED (0/100) - Missing PRD, Architecture, Epics
- Recommendation: Follow BMAD workflow for new feature development

### ✅ Phase 1: Analysis - Product Brief (Mary - Analyst)
**Completed:** 2025-12-17 (just now)
- Product Brief workflow executed with advanced elicitation
- 5 elicitation methods applied for robust vision
- Comprehensive user personas and success metrics defined

**Artifacts Generated:**
- `_bmad-output/analysis/product-brief-temporal-planetarium-2025-12-17.md`

**Product Brief Highlights:**
- **Vision:** 3-phase implementation (Week 1: 60-70%, Week 2: 85-90%, Week 3+: 95% coverage)
- **Users:** 4 detailed personas (Security researchers, consultants, wallet owners, educators)
- **Success Metrics:** Measurable KPIs for each phase
- **Scope:** Clear MVP definition with phased roadmap
- **Risks:** Comprehensive mitigation strategies
- **Status:** Ready for PRD generation

## Next Steps in BMAD Workflow

### 🔄 Phase 2: Requirements - PRD Generation (Product Manager Agent)

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Activate **Product Manager agent**
2. Execute **create-prd workflow**
3. Use Product Brief as input (`_bmad-output/analysis/product-brief-temporal-planetarium-2025-12-17.md`)
4. Generate comprehensive PRD with:
   - Functional Requirements (FRs)
   - Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
   - User stories
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical specifications

**Expected Deliverable:**
- `_bmad-output/requirements/prd-randstorm-scanner-2025-12-17.md`

### 🔄 Phase 3: Solutioning - Architecture Design (Architect Agent - Winston)

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Activate **Architect agent (Winston)**
2. Execute **create-architecture workflow**
3. Use PRD as input
4. Generate detailed architecture for Randstorm scanner:
   - Component design
   - GPU kernel architecture
   - Integration points
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Technology selection

**Expected Deliverable:**
- `_bmad-output/solutioning/architecture-randstorm-scanner-2025-12-17.md`

### 🔄 Phase 4: Planning - Epics & Stories (Product Manager Agent)

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Activate **Product Manager agent**
2. Execute **create-epics workflow**
3. Use PRD + Architecture as input
4. Break down into:
   - Epics (major features)
   - User stories (implementable units)
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Story points/estimates

**Expected Deliverable:**
- `_bmad-output/planning/epics-randstorm-scanner-2025-12-17.md`

### 🔄 Phase 5: Implementation (Developer)

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Run Implementation Readiness check again
2. Verify all artifacts aligned
3. Begin development following epics/stories
4. Implement Week 1 MVP

## Autonomous Continuation Instructions

**Moe, you said "continue autonomously"** - Here's how to proceed:

### Option A: Continue BMAD Workflow (Recommended)

I (Mary the Analyst) can hand off to the next agent in the workflow. However, I cannot directly activate other agents. You would need to:

1. **Dismiss me:** Type `*dismiss` or select option 8
2. **Activate Product Manager agent:** (you would need to do this manually)
3. **Run create-prd workflow** with Product Brief as input

### Option B: I Can Prepare Next Steps

As the Analyst, I can:
- Create a detailed handoff document for the Product Manager
- Prepare PRD outline/template with Product Brief insights
- Document requirements gathered during Product Brief
- But I cannot execute Product Manager workflows (not my role)

### Option C: Research & Analysis Support

I can continue supporting the Analysis phase by:
- Conducting market research on Randstorm vulnerability
- Competitive analysis of existing scanners
- Additional stakeholder analysis
- Risk research

---

## Recommendation for Autonomous Continuation

**Best Path Forward:**

Since you want to continue autonomously and follow the complete BMAD workflow:

1. **You need to activate the Product Manager agent next** (I cannot do this as Analyst)
2. The Product Manager will create the PRD from the Product Brief
3. Then Winston (Architect) will create detailed architecture
4. Then Product Manager creates Epics/Stories
5. Then you can implement

**However**, if you want me to continue autonomously within my role as Analyst, I can:
- Conduct deep research on Randstorm vulnerability
- Analyze competitive landscape
- Prepare comprehensive handoff materials for Product Manager

**What would you like me to do, Moe?** 📊

Type:
- `research` - I'll conduct deep research on Randstorm
- `dismiss` - I'll hand off and you can activate Product Manager
- Or tell me how you'd like me to continue autonomously within my Analyst role
