  SPRINT 1 STARTED - Updated 2025-12-25

  CURRENT SPRINT: Epic 1 - Core Scanning Engine
  - Story 1-1: MWC1616 PRNG Implementation - READY FOR DEV
  - Story file: stories/1-1-mwc1616-prng-implementation.md

  This file tracks two development tracks with RECONCILED statuses:

  1. LEGACY (legacy_development_status):
     - Original EPIC-001 through EPIC-008 from prior sprints
     - 97% complete (33/34 stories done)
     - Preserved for historical tracking and audit trail
     - Story files in stories/ folder use legacy numbering (6-1, 7-1, etc.)

  2. CURRENT (development_status):
     - New 7-epic structure from epics.md
     - Phase 1 MVP (Epics 1-5) + Phase 13 (Epics 6-7)
     - 43 stories with detailed acceptance criteria
     - **RECONCILED**: Legacy work mapped to current epic structure

  RECONCILIATION SUMMARY (2025-12-25):

  Epic 6 (Target Intelligence) ← Legacy EPIC-007:
  - 6-1-sqlite-target-database: DONE ← 007-001 (SQLite schema, indexes, bulk ops)
  - 6-2-database-import-cli: IN-PROGRESS ← 007-001 partial (CLI deferred)
  - 6-3-milk-sad-integration: DONE ← 007-002 (MSB extraction, BIP44/49/84)
  - 6-4-nonce-reuse-forensics: DONE ← 007-004 (R-value detection, AES-256-GCM)
  - 6-5-brainwallet-scanner: DONE ← 007-003 (SecLists ingestion, benchmarks)
  - 6-6-vulnerability-class-isolation: BACKLOG (new functionality)

  Epic 7 (Cross-Platform GPU) ← Legacy EPIC-008:
  - 7-1-wgsl-mwc1616-kernel-port: DONE ← 008-001 (PRNG in randstorm.wgsl)
  - 7-2-wgsl-sha256-kernel-port: DONE ← 008-001 (SHA256 + K constant fixes)
  - 7-3-wgsl-ripemd160-kernel-port: DONE ← 008-001 (80-round rewrite)
  - 7-4-wgpu-backend-integration: DONE ← 008-002 (Backend selection, Metal)
  - 7-5-wgpu-opencl-parity-ci-gate: IN-PROGRESS ← 008-002 partial (CI pending)
  - 7-6-apple-silicon-performance-optimization: BACKLOG ← 008-003

  IMPACT:
  - Phase 13 (Epics 6-7): 67% complete (8/12 done, 2 in-progress)
  - Phase 1 MVP (Epics 1-5): 0% complete (31 stories in backlog)
  - Overall: 19% complete (8/43 done)

  NEXT STEPS:
  1. Begin Sprint 1 with Epic 1 (Core Scanning Engine)
  2. Run Epic 5 (Ethics) in parallel from Sprint 1
  3. Complete remaining Epic 6/7 stories as capacity allows
